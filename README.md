# My work on the Restriction Conjecture

The folder Dimension Test contains experiments related to the restriction conjecture. It turns out what I was trying to prove is a consequence of an older paper by Dury, so you can take it as a numerical verification of that.

The folder Complex Curves Paper contains the work I'm doing right now on the subject, extending a paper by Stovall to the complex case
